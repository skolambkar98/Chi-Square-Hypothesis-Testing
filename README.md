# Chi-Square-Hypothesis-Testing

## What is Hypothesis
Hypothesis is a premise or claim we want to test/investigate

### There are two types of Hypothesis:
1. Null Hypothesis (Ho) -  Currently accepted value / parameters in the situation. 
2. Alternative Hypothesis (Ha) - Its a research hypothesis. Its a claim to be tested.

### Some parameters in Hypothesis Testing:
1. Degree of freedom: The degrees of freedom for the chi-square are calculated using the following formula: df = (r-1)(c-1) where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns.
2. Level Of Significance(α): Where do we draw the line?  What is the limit?  It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
• The level of significance 0.10 is related to the 90% confidence level.
• The level of significance 0.05 is related to the 95% confidence level.
• The level of significance 0.01 is related to the 99% confidence level.

3. p-value: Probability of obtaining a sample "More Extreme" than the ones observed in your data, assuming Ho is true (Sample is a portion out of actual population)

If pvalue > level of significance(α), then do not reject he null Hypothesis(Ho).
If pvalue <= level of dignificance(α), then reject the null Hypothesis(Ho).


In this Excel File there are 3 sheets:

1. Test if Loan Status is dependent on the Gender
2. Test if Loan Status is dependent on the Credit History
3. Test if Loan Status is dependent on the Property Area
